    <h1>Bún Bò Huế - Spicy Vietnamese Beef & Pork Noodle Soup</h1>
    <img src="../images/bun bo hue.jpeg" alt="bun bo hue" height="510" width="310">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Phở has claimed some serious territory here and has grown popular quickly. According to data from Google, since 2004 compared to March 2021, phở has grown in popularity by 830%, which is an amazing gain.</p>
    <p>It has a lot of familiar and identifiable ingredients–a good step in getting people to eat something new. BBH has a few curveballs that could be holding it back from quicker adoption: shrimp paste and pork blood.</p>
    <p>Comparatively, for the previous 12 months starting March 2021, bún bò Huế is much less popular at a measly 1.2% of the searches for phở. But why isn’t phở’s equally spicy and attractive cousin allowed to join the party?</p>
